# flipkart-seller-filter
This chrome extension adds a seller filter to Flipkart searches.

I had some flipkart EGV coupons, but they were usable only for items sold by "WS Retail". Since there was no easy way to filter results on sellers, I wrote this extension. 

This extension provides a text box, "Seller Filter", at the end of all other filters. Enter the seller name you want to filter the results on and press the "filter" button. It will dim all results at first, but then it will light up those results which are sold by the selected seller. 

Filtering by seller name cannot get easier than this. Unless FlipKart itself starts providing such a functionality itself.
